# Infinite-AIO

This is my first big project that I wrote and learned python at the same time. If you look at the whole code, you can see that in some places it is written well, but in some places it is terrible.
It's been 6 months since I started learning python and completed this project. In the future, only modules were added. All the functionality of the Discord modules was in the cloud in order to protect the code from distribution in case of a hack.
Bot users earned +-3000$ in total.
